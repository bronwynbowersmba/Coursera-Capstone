This report will be targeted to stakeholders interested in opening an **Art Gallery** in **Charlotte, NC.**\n\nBased on the current established art galleries in the Charlotte area we will try to detect **locations that are not already crowded with art galleries**. We are mostly interested in **areas with no art galleries in vicinity**. We would also prefer locations **as close to city center as possible**, assuming that first two conditions are met.\n\nWe will use our data science tools to generate a few most promising neighborhoods based on this criteria. Advantages of each area will then be clearly expressed so that best possible final location can be chosen by stakeholders."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "## Data <a name=\"data\"></a>"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "Based on definition of our problem, factors that will influence our decission are:\n* number of existing art galleries in the neighborhood (any type of art gallery)\n* number of and distance to art galleries in the neighborhood, if any\n* distance of neighborhood from city center\n\nWe decided to use regularly spaced grid of locations, centered around city center, to define our neighborhoods.\n\nFollowing data sources will be needed to extract/generate the required information:\n* centers of candidate areas will be generated algorithmically and approximate addresses of centers of those areas will be obtained using **Google Maps API reverse geocoding**\n* number of art galleries and their type and location in every neighborhood will be obtained using **Foursquare API**\n* coordinate of Charlotte, NC city center will be obtained using **Google Maps API geocoding** of well known Charlotte, NC location (Spectrum Center)"}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.6", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.6.9", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
